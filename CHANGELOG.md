- Fix bugs with `ConnectionHandler` bindings not working.
- Add bindings for getting and setting arrays of primitives as values on `RecordProxy`.
- Move from data-last to data-first to better adhere to what BuckleScript is pushing.
- Add `ReasonRelayUtils` module with helpers for dealing with arrays and connections.
